2.  Prevent the counter from going below 0.
3.  Prevent the counter from going above 20.
4.  Turn the counter red when it's 10 or higher.
    4a. Change it back to the original color if it goes below 10.
5.  Allow the initial count to be set from a prop.

7.  Add a button to reset the counter.
    7a. Only show this button if the counter has been modified from its original state.
