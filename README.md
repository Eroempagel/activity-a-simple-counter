# activity-a-simple-counter

Activity to create a simple counter using what we've learned about React so far.

Tasks as follows: 
Build the counter. 
Prevent the counter from going below 0. 
Prevent the counter from going above 20. 
Turn the counter red when it's 10 or higher. 
Change it back to the original color if it goes below 10. 
Allow the initial count to be set from a prop. 
If an initial count is not passed in, the count should start at 0. 
Add a button to reset the counter. 
Only show this button if the counter has been modified from its original state.
